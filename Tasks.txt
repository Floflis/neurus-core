"Note that Neurus uses shell-genie, and its server will store the requested command, OS, and shell version to improve the model. Also, we cannot guarantee that the server will be up and running 24/7."
"Do you want to provide feedback about the generated commands to improve the models?"
"Config file saved at /home/daniella/.config/.shell_genie/config.json"
